  "summaryText": "\"I am driven by development and motivation-driven change. Do you think that alone is strong and that individual activities are what create success – well, then you will have no use for me. If, on the other hand, you think that a long-term approach, a clear path, a strong culture with motivated, committed and energetic employees is the way to success and a winning team - well, then I am happy to contribute on that journey. Because it's always a journey and I can only contribute as a guide, as well as challenge and give structure. Management must own and passionately drive all change. My experience as CEO and chairman of the board in various businesses is very clear – Without the management's commitment, it will just be a lot of talk and waste of resources. And that's never been the hallmark of a winning company\"",
